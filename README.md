This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.

## Goal

 - "Responsive" Design +
 - Modern JS Frameworks - Angular +
 - SCSS+
 - This feature shows your ability to pass "state" or "updates"/"events" among the components of the web application. Navigating between pages should not reset the site-wide/global state.+
 - Reloading the page can clear the state. Persistence is not required. +
 - What to store: Language (See Localization) "User Info" (See Login Modal)  - (login page & register page)
 - User should stay on the same page when localization changes. +
 - Navigating to a new page or going back should not change the language set. (See State Management) +

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
